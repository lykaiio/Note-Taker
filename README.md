# Note-Taker
---
A GUI Project focused on a user-friendly digital note-taking application. 
This tool will enable users, primarily students, to effortlessly create and manage convenient digital sticky notes.
I have limited the amount of sticky notes to 3 because that is the most managable way I can code this project within my own skill and knowledge set.

Features:
* 3 Sticky notes available with an overwrite function
* Customizable sticky notes (font, color, and text)
* Ability to pin the application with forced focus on the window over other applications
* Quick edit button
